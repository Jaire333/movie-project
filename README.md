# Movie Site Project
Today you will be creating some functions that could be used on a movie website like Netflix. 

## Set-Up Your Project
First, we need to check out the project.

* On this page, click **Fork** in the top right to get your own copy
* Then open up Cloud9. Go to Respositories, find **movie-project** and click **Clone to edit**.
* Name the Workspace as **movie-project**, leave all other settings as default and click **Create workspace**.

## Open the test file
Open `index.html` in your project workspace and live preview the file. 
The tests on `index.html` validate your code and will point out errors if it finds them.
If the tests are all green, then your project is correct!

## Finish the Javascript File
Open `solution.js` in your project workspace

Follow the instructions in the comments of the javascript file. To complete this assignment, you will need to make an array called movieQueue, and four functions described in the file:
- addMovieToFront
- addMovieToEnd
- changeMovie
- getMovie

## Submission
You are expected to complete and submit this exercises by the end of the week!
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "movie-project"
git push origin master
git push origin master:gh-pages
```
